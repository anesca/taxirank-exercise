# Taxi Rank - Exercise

Exercise to simulate a typical South African taxi rank

Using C++ and the linear data structures of queues and stacks, this project simulates a queue-based minibus taxi rank systemâ€”a common public transport method across Africa. The simulation will involve three types of taxis:

Short-distance (S)
Long-distance (L)
City routes (C)

Passengers arrive at the taxi rank and queue according to their destination. When a taxi becomes available, they board in an orderly manner based on their position in the queue. Each passenger requires some processing time to complete the onboarding process, which includes boarding the taxi and settling in.
